    "# Project: Optimizing the Hospital Patient Journey via Process Mining and MLOps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and Context\n",
    "This project aims to analyze operational and clinical flows within the hospital facility using advanced **Process Mining** techniques. The goal is to reconstruct the actual *Patient Journey* starting from **Event Logs**, identifying inefficiencies and bottlenecks. In parallel, we will develop an **MLOps** pipeline to predict critical events or excessive durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "1.  **Process Visualization:** Map the actual flow of activities (admission, exams..).\n",
    "2.  **Performance Analysis:** Calculate throughput times and identify bottlenecks.\n",
    "3.  **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Analysis):** Identify non-compliant paths or cases with anomalous timings.\n",
    "4.  **Predictive Modeling:** Develop a predictive model for waiting times or the next clinical event.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology and Tech Stack\n",
    "* **Language:** Python \n",
    "* **Process Mining:** PM4Py (for discovery and conformance checking).\n",
    "* **Machine Learning:** - \n",
    "* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy.\n",
    "* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly \n",
    "* **MLOps:** MLflow, Git\n",

    "## Role Division\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize efficiency, we will divide the team into specialized roles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role 1: Data Engineer & MLOps Architect (Elisa)\n",
    "* **Responsibilities:** Creation of the data ingestion pipeline. Preliminary cleaning and log formatting (XES/CSV). Environment configuration (Git, DVC, Docker).\n",
    "* **Focus:** \"Garbage in, garbage out\". Ensures that data arrives clean to the analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role 2: Data Scientist (Process Mining Analyst and Discovery) (Rosa)\n",
    "* **Responsibilities:** Using PM4Py to generate process maps and graphs. Analysis of path variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role 3: Data Scientist (Conformance & Bottlenecks) (Lorenza)\n",
    "* **Responsibilities:** Temporal performance analysis. Identification of bottlenecks (where do patients wait the most?). Comparison between the theoretical model and the real one.\n",
    "* **Focus:** Understanding \"why is it slow\" or \"where do we deviate from the standard\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role 4: Feature Engineering and Software Developer (Malik)\n",
    "* **Responsibilities:** Transforming logs into tabular datasets for ML. Feature creation (\"time elapsed since last event\", \"day of the week\"). Statistical analysis of outliers.\n",
    "* **Focus:** Preparing the ground for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role 5: MLOPs Engineering (Predictive Modeling) (Gleb)\n",
    "* **Responsibilities:** Training and validation of predictive models. Hyperparameter tuning and experiment tracking with MLflow.\n",
    "* **Focus:** Answering the question \"what will happen next?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role 6: Project Manager & Data Storyteller (Anna)\n",
    "* **Responsibilities:** Team coordination. Defining success KPIs. Interpretation of technical results from a business/clinical perspective. Creation of the final dashboard and presentation.\n",
    " **Privacy Guardian:** Ethical oversight of data usage and verification of compliance (GDPR) regarding the produced results."
